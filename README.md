# ForcesToGensSETConverter
Converts object layout data from Sonic Forces to Sonic Generations. 
<br />Drag and drop a Forces .gedit onto ForcesToGensSETConverter.exe to get a .set.xml file for use in Generations.
<br />
<br />This is a WIP, not all Forces objects will convert to Gens
<br />Unsupported objects will convert to a new .set.xml with the forces object names, position, and rotation.
<br />Thanks to Radfordhound for the original code. 
<br />And to Skyth, Sajid, and SuperSonic16 for additional coding help.
